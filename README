Simple Image Crop Tool
======================

Introduction
------------

Crop the surrounding white background of one or more images and write back to 
the original file(s); or crop one image and write to a separate file. Useful 
before inserting figures to reports, for example. The initial motive for the 
author to create the script is to add it to pre-build script of LaTeX build 
Makefile. 


Usage
-----

	crop IMAGEPATH [ IMAGEPATH ...] [-o OUTPUTPATH]


Dependency
----------

`ImageMagick`


Mechanism
---------

Just a Python3 wrapper around `magick [INPUTIMAGE] -trim [OUTPUTIMAGE]` for 
convenient use. 

If the `ImageMagick` command is `convert`, one may need to modify the 
`DEFAULT_CROP_COMMAND` in `crop.py` adaptively.
